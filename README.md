# Hand-Gesture-Detection-for-Device-Volume-Control
Implemented a computer vision-based system that recognizes hand gestures to control device volume, combining AI/ML algorithms with real-time gesture recognition for intuitive human-computer interaction.

Hand Gesture Detection for Device Volume Control

A computer vision project that enables **hands-free volume control** using **real-time hand gesture detection** via a webcam. The system reads hand gestures (like finger distance or count) and adjusts the system volume accordingly â€” ideal for smart interfaces or touch-free environments.

What the Project Does

- Detects hand gestures from a live webcam feed
- Calculates the distance between fingers or counts raised fingers
- Maps gestures to system volume changes (increase/decrease/mute)
- Provides live visual feedback (like bounding boxes, volume bar)

Why the Project is Useful

- Enables **contactless interaction** with your device
- Ideal for:
  - Smart homes or IoT interfaces
  - Accessibility applications
  - Gesture-controlled media players
- Enhances user experience through intuitive control
